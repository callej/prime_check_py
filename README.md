# Prime Number Check

This is a small Python program that uses a regular expression to check if a number is prime. It also lists the prime numbers up to 100 using the same regular expression to check if a number is prime.

### IMPORTANT!
It is extremely inefficient to use a regular expression to check if a number is prime. However, it is a fascinating way to show how a very short and simple regular expression can be used for this purpose. Just note that this is very inefficient and memory demanding for any larger primes. It should not be used for any production code. Checking primes over 1000000 on a budget laptop might be a challenging and time consuming task for that poor machine.
